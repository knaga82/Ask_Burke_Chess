# Ask_Burke_Chess
Ask Burke, your Chess Assistant

This is a fork of: https://github.com/AlejoG10/python-chess-ai-yt

I am adding capability to talk to an LLM assistant (Burke) in order to get:
- FEN representation of the position of the board
- Evaluations of the board current position
- White/Black's next suggested move
- Score of the board's current position

All of these are pop-ups that are triggered by keys on the keyboard.  These 'hot keys' can be seen when the user types 'h' for help.

Pending:
- Make the pop up look nicer
- Try other LLMs (GPT 4o isnt very good at Chess)
